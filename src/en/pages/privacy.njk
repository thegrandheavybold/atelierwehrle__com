            to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>

      <h3 class="h6">Storage duration</h3>
      <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with
            us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for deletion
            or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible
            reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the
            deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
      <h3 class="h6">General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>
      <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9
            (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of explicit
            consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49 (1)(a)
            GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end device (e.g.,

            pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is

            privacy policy.</p>

      <p>In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, this also
            requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external
            parties if this is required as part of the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g.,
            disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6
            (1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using processors, we only
            disclose personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint
            processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>

            at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data
            collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>

            the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative
            or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p>

      <h3 class="h6">Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
      <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your archived
            personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at any time. You

            or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.</p>
      <h3 class="h6">Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
      <p>You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
            concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the
            following cases:</p>
      <ul>
            <li>In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some
                    time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to
                    demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand
                    the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.</li>
            <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
                    entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
                    of its eradication.</li>
            <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
                    weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the

            protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by
            the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>
      <h3 class="h6">SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
      <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries
            you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can
            recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
            &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
      </p>
      <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
      <h3 class="h6">Rejection of unsolicited e-mails</h3>
      <p>We herewith object to the use of contact information published in conjunction with the mandatory information to be
            provided in our Site Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have not expressly requested.
            The operators of this website and its pages reserve the express right to take legal action in the event of the
            unsolicited sending of promotional information, for instance via SPAM messages.</p>
      <h2 class="h5">4. Recording of data on this website</h2>
      <h3 class="h6">Server log files</h3>
      <p>The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log

      <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
      <p>This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the
            technically error free depiction and the optimization of the operator&rsquo;s website. In order to achieve this,
            server log files must be recorded.</p>
      <h3 class="h6">Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
      <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request)
            will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on
            without your consent.</p>
      <p>These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a
            contract or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are
            processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art.
            6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained; the consent can be
            revoked at any time.</p>

      <p>When you access pages of this website, your browser will automatically load the required fonts directly from the

            consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to information in the user&rsquo;s end device (e.g., device
            fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. This consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
